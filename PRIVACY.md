# DevTool+ Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2025-08-16

This Privacy Policy explains how the DevTool+ Visual Studio Code extension (“DevTool+”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) handles information. DevTool+ is designed to run entirely on your machine. We do not collect, store, or transmit personal data or user content.

If you have any questions, please contact us via the project’s GitHub repository: https://github.com/fuzionix/devtool-plus

## Summary

- We do not collect any personal data.
- We do not send any data to external servers.
- All processing happens locally within VS Code on your device.
- Any files you open or create with DevTool+ remain on your machine unless you choose to share them.

## Scope

This Policy applies to the DevTool+ VS Code extension distributed via the Visual Studio Code Marketplace and its open-source repository.

Note: Visual Studio Code and the VS Code Marketplace are separate products operated by Microsoft. They may collect telemetry or usage data independent of this extension. See Microsoft’s respective policies for details.

## What We Do Not Collect

We do not:
- Collect, log, or store personal information or usage analytics.
- Track your behavior, usage patterns, or tool interactions.
- Transmit your content, files, clipboard data, secrets, or configuration outside your device.
- Use cookies, beacons, or third-party trackers.

## What Stays On Your Device

- All inputs, outputs, transformations, and editor content (including any keys, tokens, or secrets used within DevTool+ tools) are processed locally within the VS Code environment.
- Any temporary state is held in memory inside the VS Code extension host or webviews and is not transmitted externally.

## Network Activity

- DevTool+ does not make outgoing network requests.
- External links (for example, to the GitHub repository) open only if you click them and are handled by your system/browser. Visiting those sites is outside the scope of this Policy.
- Extension installation, updates, or marketplace interactions are handled by VS Code/Marketplace infrastructure, not by DevTool+.

## File and Clipboard Access

- DevTool+ interacts with files only when you explicitly open, drop, or save them within the extension’s UI.
- Saving files uses VS Code’s native save dialog; content is written only to the path you choose.
- We do not scan or read files on your system without your action.
- Clipboard operations, if used, remain local to your system.

## Telemetry, Crash Reports, and Logging

- DevTool+ does not include telemetry or analytics.
- We do not send crash reports or logs to any server.
- Any console logging is local to your VS Code environment.

## Third-Party Services and Dependencies

- DevTool+ bundles client-side libraries (e.g., Monaco Editor, Lit) locally with the extension.
- No third-party service calls are performed by the extension.
- Dependencies operate within VS Code’s sandbox and do not transmit your data.

## Data Security

While DevTool+ processes everything locally and does not transmit your data, you remain responsible for:
- Securing your machine and development environment.
- Managing secrets and sensitive content you choose to process with the tools.
- Reviewing external links before opening them.

## Changes to This Policy

If we change how DevTool+ handles data (for example, by adding telemetry or online features), we will update this Policy and the extension release notes to describe the changes and, where required, obtain consent.

</p>

</br>

## 📖 Introduction

DevTool+ brings common developer tools into VSCode. It provides a set of utilities that can be used directly in the code editor, enhancing productivity and streamlining workflows. It includes features like a calculator, unit converter, and more, all accessible without leaving the coding environment.

The extension features two main sections:
- **Side Panel**: A compact view with an upper I/O section for tool interactions and a lower section listing all tools.
- **Editor Section**: A full-screen editor panel for more complex tasks (e.g., code editing or diff checking).

Built with native VSCode UI components and Lit for a responsive, familiar experience. All tools are dynamic and customizable. 🌟

## ✨ Features

- [🔒 **Security**] - All tools run locally in VSCode—no data is sent to external servers, ensuring privacy and offline usability.
- [🧰 **Integration with Editor**] - Directly embedded into VSCode workflow; Use tools in the side panel without leaving your coding environment.
- [🛠️ **Diverse Toolset**] - Over 30 tools across categories like Data, Encoding, Design, Text, and Cryptography. (Will keep expanding)
- [📔 **Native UI Language**] - Have native-like UI components (e.g., code editors, diff viewers) powered by Lit for a polished, theme-aware interface.
- [⚡ **Real-Time Update**] - Tools like editors and converters update instantly, with features like auto-formatting, validation, and live previews.
- [💻 **Performance**] - Built with Lit for fast, efficient rendering and minimal resource usage.
- [🔍 **Searchable Tools**] - Quickly find tools by name, category, or tags.
